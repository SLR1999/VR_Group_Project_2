# VR_Group_Project_2 (Dress Recognition)

A camera is placed at the entrance of a retail shop. 
Your company supplies the video analytics solution
to this shop. You are given a snap i.e. a image frame 
sampled every 5 second. 
 
Assuming people enter one-by-one at the entrance, 
you have to find if there is a person in every snap, and
if so what are they wearing - "Formal Shirt/ T-shirt/
Saree/Kurti/None of the above. 
 
Build such a system. Clue: Use a pretrained person
detector with the help of Faster RCNN/YOLO. 
Create a dataset for the above categories and train
a couple of different models. Do consider fine tuning 
a deep learning model as well, using the training data. 
Keep the test data separate. Report your assumptions, 
results and observations in detail.
